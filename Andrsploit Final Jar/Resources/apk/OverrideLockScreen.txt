OverrideLockScreen
---------
OverrideLockScreen is an Android app I wrote that will assist you in unlocking a phone.

Since ADB doesn't always give you root, you might be limited in what you can do. However, the standard ADB shell user is also very powerful.

 * OverrideLockScreen is now built into the regular toolset!

 * To install OverrideLockScreen, you simply need to run
   * `adb install OverrideLockScreen.apk`

 * To unlock the screen once install
   * `adb shell am start -S org.sourcebit.OverrideLockScreen/.MainActivity`

 * To uninstall, hit the uninstall button, or run this command
   * `adb uninstall org.sourcebit.OverrideLockScreen`
